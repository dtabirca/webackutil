- A single file web interface to backup and restore databases and files
- PHP calls external bash/batch scripts to perform the tasks.

## TODO
- Keep archives and logs for last 5 backups only
- Backup source files (folders inside public web folder)
- Recognise WP, Drupal etc. database structures and provide additional specific functions 
(enter maintenance mode etc)
- Use this with other SQL databases as well
- Secure with password
